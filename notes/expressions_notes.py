#MW 7th EXPRESSIONS NOTES

#What is an algorithm?

# A set of instructions to complete a task.
name = input("What is your name?\n")
print("Hello,",name)
# WORD PROBLEM EXAMPLE
# Treyson has 12 apples he has 5 friends that he wants to give apples to, how many does each friend get
apples=12
friends=5
print("Each friend gets", apples/friends, "apples.")

#List steps in an algorithm

#1. Declare variables. (aka get the info we need.) 2. Preform any equations you have to do. 3. Display the results.
#Average age group of a group of 4 people
ages1 = 66
age2 = 24
age3 = 43
age4 = 53
total_ages = ages1 + age2 + age3 + age4
average= total_ages/4

print("The average age is of the group is,", average,)

#List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
num_one = int(input("tell me a number:\n"))
num_two = float(input("tell me another number:\n"))
num_two = 3

print("Addition(+) ", num_one)
num_one-=num_two
print("Subtracion(-) ", num_one)
num_one*=num_two
print("Multiplication(*) ", num_one)
num_one/=num_two
print("Division(/) ",num_one) #round(number to round, number of decimal places)
num_one**=num_two
print("Exponents(**) ", num_one)
num_one//=num_two
print("Integer Division(//) ", num_one)
num_one%=num_two
print("Modulo(%) ", num_one)
#INTAGER DIVISION WILL GIVE YOU A WHOLE NUMBER, NUMBERS WITH DECIMALS ARE CALLED FLOATS. MODULO GIVES YOU THE REMAINDER OF THE DIVISION. ROUND BEFORE THE VARIABLES WILL ROUND IT


#List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does)
#It is the = and you can use int and float

#Why are expressions so important in programming?
