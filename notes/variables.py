#What is a variable?
#  a variable is a value that can change

#How do I assign a variable?
# Give it a name, then use a assignment operator to give it a value (=), then give it a value. NO SPACES use _ and all letters lowercase. can use camel case, second word and beyond start with a capital and get rid of the spaces. Pascal case is when you capitalize the first letter of every word, no spaces. DO NOT MAKE A VARIABLE MORE THAN 3 WORDS
school= "UCAS"
singleDigit= 4
DoubleDigit= 24
#How do I reassign a variable?
# Change the content in the variable
school= 1000000000
print(school)
#How do I create an input into my program?
# to get a input from user write "input" then do () and in the parenthesis ask the user a question.
name= input("What is your name?")

print("Hello,", name )

#How many things can be put into the same print statement?
