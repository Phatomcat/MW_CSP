# I DID IT!
#MW 7th STRING NOTES

#What makes something a string?
# A set of symbols held together by quotation marks.
first_name = input('What is your first name:\n').strip().title()
last_name = input('What is your last name:\n').strip().title()
s='sksksksksks'
full_name= first_name+' '+last_name
print('welcome to my program:',full_name +'!')
sentence="Hello i am a"
print(sentence.find("Hello"))
print(sentence[sentence.find("Hello"): len("Hello")+sentence.find("Hello")])

#How do stupid proofing and sanitization relate to each other?
#Happens on inputs, examples like .strip .title .lower .upper. Stupid proofing is when you specifically build the code so your user can't break your code.

#What is debugging?
#  Debugging is the process of fixing your program.
    #Syntax error- A mistake in your grammer. Examples spaces where there not supossed to be, forgetting commas quotation marks. 
    #Logic Error- When the code looks fine, but the output is not what you want.
    #Runtime Error- When the code works until it stops.

#How do you debug the different types of errors?
#

#Describe what each of the methods below does:


#find()

#finds the begining index for a word.

#concatenate (add)

#puts 2 stings together

#upper()

# uppercases the letters

#lower()
